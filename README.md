## Introduction

The Labs project at school [42 São Paulo](https://www.42sp.org.br/) has the proposal that interested students develop a proposed challenge in order to get a 6-month experience in some of the partner companies.

It provides a very important stage in the life of a cadet, since it is the first contact with the job market. It is necessary that the student is at least in the first project of the second phase of the game: the Push Swap - creation of a program to sort numbers -, since the challenge of the selection process in question challenges us in some more advanced subjects, such as Linked List, binary tree, bitwise operations and shared memory.

Short on time? You can check the [challenge subject 🥵](https://github.com/fegastal/42SP-Labs-Notes/blob/main/SUBJECT.md)!

- **Phase 1 - Initial Studies 📚**

After reading the subject, I had an impression that it was a project similar to the creation of two programs - server and client - that communicate through signals (SIGUSR1 e SIGUSR2), [MiniTalk](https://github.com/fegastal/42SP-Labs-Notes/blob/main/documents/Minitalk_fgastal-.pdf).

However, the communication between the two programs in question - encoder and decoder - should be via [Shared Memory Operations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8tR6d47bCc), something I had not seen in the course of my studies, until then.

In order to understand these new concepts and map out the new challenges ahead of me, I chose to follow initial references on the topic, such as:

> This playlist on YouTube: [Huffman's Algorithm in C](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8UPZ_KDWdU&list=PLqJK4Oyr5WShtxF1Ch3Vq4b1Dzzb-WxbP&index=1)

> And this book: [Mastering Algorithms with C - Useful Techniques from Sorting to Encryption](https://www.amazon.com.br/Mastering-Algorithms-C-Kyle-Loudon/dp/1565924533)

These two references were essential to give continuity to the challenge, which was to be delivered in 6 days. 🤯

- **Phase 2 - Data Structures 🕸**

> 2.1 Huffman's Tree 🌳

In order to start studying data structures, I tried to understand how the Huffman Tree works. Based on the playlist indicated above, I was able to get a good understanding. :)

Basically, when we have files - be it images, video, audio or text - that occupy a large amount of memory because they are heavy, we have the possibility to compress them - it can be by winrar, 7zip or any other software.

In this sense, pixel points with very similar colors can be converted into one color, decreasing the file size, for example.

With the Huffman Algorithm - proposed by David A. Huffman in 1952 during his doctorate at MIT - it is possible to adapt it to compress any type of file, but it is also widely used for text, since it is very efficient and lossless. Come to think of it, this very important algorithm was implemented 70 years ago! 👀

⚠️ What is so interesting about it? 

It makes use of several data structures, such as table, chained list or priority queue, and binary tree. :D It's a lot!

So we need to focus on the coding steps:

🐾 1 | Determine the frequency of each element

For example, in the sentence "I want to get an internship", we have a certain frequency of occurrence for each character, if we want to compact this text.

In this case, we have:

<a href=""><img src="https://github.com/fegastal/42SP-Labs-Notes/blob/main/documents/image/frequency_table.png" alt="Frequency Table"></a>

symbol  | frequency |
---|------|
`q` | 1	|
`u` | 3	|
`e` | 2 |
`r` | 2 |
`o` | 3 |
`c` | 1	|
`n` | 1 |
`s` | 2 |
`i` | 2 |
` ` | 3 |
`m` | 1	|
`t` | 1 |
`a` | 1 |
`g` | 2	|

For this table to be generated, it was necessary to create 3 specific functions:

The function "initializes_tab_with_zero" has the goal of making the table initialization from zero elements, considering that TAM equals 256.

The function "fill_tab_frequency" receives both the characters (char) that are passed as a text array, as well as the amount of their frequency (int);

The function "print_tab_frequency" takes the table generated in the previous function and prints it to the terminal. :) It was used as a test, basically.

In the figure below, we can analyze how this table is generated in the output:





🐾 2 | Montar uma árvore binária

Nessa etapa, agrupamos os símbolos de acordo com a frequência.
