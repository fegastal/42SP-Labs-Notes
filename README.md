## Introduction

The Labs project at school [42 SÃ£o Paulo](https://www.42sp.org.br/) has the proposal that interested students develop a proposed challenge in order to get a 6-month experience in some of the partner companies.

It provides a very important stage in the life of a cadet, since it is the first contact with the job market. It is necessary that the student is at least in the first project of the second phase of the game: the Push Swap - creation of a program to sort numbers -, since the challenge of the selection process in question challenges us in some more advanced subjects, such as Linked List, binary tree, bitwise operations and shared memory.

Short on time? You can check the [challenge subject ðŸ¥µ](https://github.com/fegastal/42SP-Labs-Notes/blob/main/SUBJECT.md)!

- **The Challenge**

After reading the subject, I had an impression that it was a project similar to the creation of two programs that communicate through signals, [MiniTalk](https://github.com/fegastal/42SP-Labs-Notes/blob/main/documents/Minitalk_fgastal-.pdf). 

However, the communication between the two programs in question - encoder and decoder - should be via Shared Memory Operations.

In order to understand these new concepts and map out the new challenges ahead of me, I chose to follow initial references on the topic, such as:
